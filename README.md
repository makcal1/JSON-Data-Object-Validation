An example project of API response validation using Rest Assured with a so-called JSON Object Library to testing and parsing the JSON response from a real-time environment can be found here.

The idea is to use this library to replace and simplify existing code for validating JSON responses after converting JSON Object to string object.

I also used Json Path Finder (link provided below) to effectively identify the JSON path.

The next goal is to develop an algorithm that can communicate with multiple components at the same time, such as a database, an API gateway, and a server, as well as send JSON messages and verify messages using the Apache Kafka stream-processing platform.
